<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
   Dr. Meng Pang is currently a Distinguished Professor in School of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Nanchang
University. Before that, he was a Postdoc Research Fellow in School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
</p>
<p>
    i received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China, in 2019, and received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in software engineering from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests include signal processing, pattern recognition, and adversarial machine learning. He has authored/co-authored over 15 scientific papers in international journals and conferences, such as IEEE TIFS, TNNLS, TCSVT, PR, CIKM, ICME and ICIP. He is the Guest Editor of Frontiers in Big Data. He is a regular reviewer of several top-tier field journals and conferences, such as TNNLS, TCSVT, PR, T-Cybernetics, CVPR, ECCV, AAAI and ICME.
